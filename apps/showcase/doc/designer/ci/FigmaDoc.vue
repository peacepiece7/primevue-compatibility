            Token Studio in Figma is the starting point of a continuous integration pipeline. You can connect a remote repository to sync your tokens data so that changes are saved remotely instead of locally. Token Studio offers various remote
            storage options such as <a href="https://docs.tokens.studio/token-storage/remote/sync-git-github" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>,
            <a href="https://docs.tokens.studio/token-storage/remote/sync-git-gitlab" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitLab</a> and
            <a href="https://docs.tokens.studio/token-storage/remote/sync-git-bitbucket" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitbucket</a>. Refer to these documentations based on your environment before proceeding to the integrations in the
            next section.
